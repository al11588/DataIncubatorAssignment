# Data Incubator Assignment

# Description:

I created an experiment where a coin is tossed 20 times and 5 heads are observed.

# Question:

* **Hypothesis Testing**: Let’s talk about t-tests, p-values. How are they
related? What is it telling you? How does it relate to precision-recall?
What are the underlying assumptions?

# Answer:

Hypothesis testing tests the outcomes of an experiment to see if there are any important results. When it comes to Hypothesis testing there are two terms that individuals need to know. The two terms individuals need to know is T-test and P-Values. A T- Test compares two averages to let you know if they are different from one another. On the other hand, P-Values checks to see the probability of a null hypothesis in the study question is true. T-tests and P-values are related since both are trying to find out if the null hypothesis is true or not. This relates to precision-recall because it helps in measuring the success of a hypothesis when there are imbalanced classes. The underlying assumption is that precision helps in calculating relevancy. On the other hand, recall helps in calculating how many applicable results returned. 

# Question:

* **Bayesian posterior inference**: Explain Bayes’ Rule. Write some code to
actually perform posterior sampling. Work out an example using conjugate
priors. How does this compare with hypothesis testing? What are the
underlying assumptions?

# Answer:

Bayes Rule finds the probability of an event based on the previous information related from that event. This posterior sampling compares to hypothesis testing since we are making an educated guess to find the results of 20 tosses when observing 5 heads. Eventually helping us to compare it to the null Hypothesis. The underlying assumption is that we make 20 tosses and we observe 5 heads.
